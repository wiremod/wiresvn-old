# wiresvn-old
Import from the old wiremod SVN found on google code up to commit 1062. This means that with the current git history, we're only missing a month or two, but the major landmarks should now all be accounted for. File: repo.svndump.gz

Need to create an authors.txt file in order to properly convert history to git.
